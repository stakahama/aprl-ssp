Substructure search program

[TOC]

Introduction
===

This program is made up of two parts:

* "spider_query.py": Queries the ChemSpider database for SMILES strings and other properties of a molecule.
* "substructure\_search.py": Uses the Open Babel chemoinformatics tool to find number of instances of a substructure (specified by SMARTS pattern) occurring in a molecule (specified by SMILES pattern).

### Setup

You may want to add the directory of the program path so that the two python scripts can be accessed anywhere. In Linux/Mac (include in `~/.bash_profile` to make this available across various terminal sessions):

```sh
$ export PATH=/path/to/aprl-structsearch:$PATH
```

In Windows (use setx instead of set to make available across various terminal sessions):

```dos
set PATH=%PATH%;Z:/path/to/aprl-substructsearch
```
See [here](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm) for GUI instructions (there may be better sites).

All examples are run in the "examples/" subdirectory provided assuming the program directory has been included in the PATH variable.

### Python

Both programs require python. Anaconda distribution is recommended as it comes with the pandas library (assumed installed in further instructions). Python is installed with Mac OS X but a separate installation of the scientific python stack is recommended. Package installation can be carried through with the pip package manager:

```sh
$ pip install packagename
```

"substructure_search.py" additionally requires Open Babel (link to installation guide included below).

spider_query.py
===

### Setup

Required python packages:

* chemspipy (search from chemspider). For more information, see [http://chemspipy.readthedocs.org/](http://chemspipy.readthedocs.org/).

### Arguments

Query to CSV is the default. Flags to change this behavior:

* `-D`: search compounds in database rather than ChemSpider
* `-d`: output to database
* `-b`: output to both database and CSV file

Three main arguments:

* `-p`: value of `PREFIX`. Name of prefix to database or CSV tables. When `-D` is present, this also indicates the name of database to be read in. If unspecified, will default to "queryresults".
* `-i`: value of `INPUTFILE` (optional). Name of file containing compounds. Optional if `-D`; otherwise required.
* `-t`: value of `TOKENFILE` (optional). Name of file containing ChemSpider token if not "~/.chemspidertoken". See next section.

### Examples

Input/output included in folder "examples/".

* Query to CSV:

    ```
    $ spider_query.py -p example -i compounds.csv
	```

    This will create files called "examples\_main.csv" and "examples\_alternates.csv".

* Query to database only:

    ```
    $ spider_query.py -d -p example -i compounds.csv
	```

    This will create a file called "examples\_p.db".  ("_p" stands for python "pickle object created by shelve module)

* Query to both database and CSV:

    ```
    $ spider_query.py -b -p example -i compounds.csv
	```

    This will create files called "examples\_main.csv", "examples\_alternates.csv", and "examples\_db.p".

* Database to CSV:

    ```
    $ spider_query.py -D -p example -i compounds.csv
	```

    This will read compounds from file called "examples\_p.db" and create files called "examples\_main.csv", "examples\_alternates.csv". if `-i compounds.csv` is omitted, all compounds in the database will be included.

### Token

If the [ChemSpider token](http://chemspipy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/intro.html#obtaining-a-security-token) is not written to "~/.chemspidertoken", specify its location with the `-t` argument. For instance,

```
$ spider_query.py  -t /path/to/token.txt -p example -i compounds.csv
```

substructure_search.py
===

### Setup

Required external programs:

* Open Babel (http://openbabel.org/wiki/Category:Installation)

Required python packages:

* pybel (interface to Open Babel)

### Arguments

Main arguments:

* `-g`: value of `GROUPFILE`. Name of file which contains columns {substructure, pattern}. An additional column, "export", consisting of 0/1 values indicating whether this substructure should be included in `OUTPUTFILE` is allowed.
* `-i`: value of `INPUTFILE`. Name of file which contains columns {compound, SMILES}.
* `-o`: value of `OUTPUTFILE`. Name of file which contains matrix of compound x substructure.
* `-e`: value of `EXPORT` (optional). Name of file which contains list of substructures to include in `OUTPUTFILE`. Overrides "export" column if present in `GROUPFILE`.

Flags:

* `-d`: When present, indicates that `GROUPFILE` exists in the subdirectory, `SMARTSpatterns/`, distributed with "substructure_search.py".

### Examples

```
$ python substructure_search.py -d -g FTIRgroups.csv \
  -i example_main.csv -o example_out.csv
```

### Additional information

Patterns specified in GROUPFILE can be derived from a combination of SMARTS patterns. For instance, `ester_all` is defined as `"[CX3,CX3H1](=O)[OX2H0][#6]"`. `nitroester` is defined as `"[#6][OX2H0][CX3,CX3H1](=O)[C;$(C[N+](=O)[O-]),$(CC[N+](=O)[O-]),$(CCC[N+](=O)[O-]),$(CCCC[N+](=O)[O-]),$(CCCCC[N+](=O)[O-])]"`. `ester` can be defined as `{ester_all}-{nitroester}`. When present, such custom patterns are computed after all the SMARTS patterns have been matched and counted.
